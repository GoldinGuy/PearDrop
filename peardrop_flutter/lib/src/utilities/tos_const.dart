Terms of Use

PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. These terms of use (“Agreement”) govern your use of our PearDrop software, products, and/or services (collectively, “Products”) and any information, content or appearing on or through the Products (collectively referred to as “Content”). By accessing or using the Products, you agree to the terms of this Agreement. If you have entered into another agreement with PearDrop concerning specific Products, then the terms of that agreement controls where it conflicts with these terms. PearDrop reserves the right, at any time, to modify, alter, update or remove portions of this Agreement. Please check this Agreement (as well as our privacy policy) from time to time as your continued use of the Product signifies your acceptance of any changed items.

1. YOUR LICENSE TO USE OUR PRODUCTS.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any agreement entered into by your institution relating to the Products, PearDrop grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to access and use the Products. You shall not (a) copy the Product or any part, feature, function or user interface thereof (b) use the Product to store or transmit infringing, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, or to store or transmit material in violation of third-party privacy rights (c) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Product or its related systems or networks; and (d) reverse engineer the Product (to the extent such restriction is permitted by law).

You agree, further, not to use or attempt to use any engine, software, tool, agent or other device or other mechanism (including without limitation browsers, spiders, robots, avatars or intelligent agents) to navigate or search the Products or Content.

2. PRIVACY.

This privacy policy covers the services accessed using PearDrop. PearDrop is a tool that allows users to share files between different devices, with no restrictions. These days, closed ecosystems surround us. iPhones only share with Apple devices, Android phones only with Windows, etc. Sending a file from one place to another is difficult and frustrating, usually requiring you to send an email to yourself. This is not acceptable, and PearDrop aims to solve this issue. PearDrop is an application built on a custom protocol that is available on every platform (Apple, Google, Windows, etc). This allows for simple and efficient file transfer when you really need it. PearDrop does not store or alter your data in any way. You can access PearDrop by downloading it at https://peardrop.app or through app stores. 

This Privacy Policy describes PearDrop’s privacy practices in relation to information or file data transferred through the app and made available by us for use on or through devices that link to this Privacy Policy (the “App”).

Information We Collect

“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual. No personal information is collected by PearDrop. PearDrop uses device names, IP addresses, device type, and limited file information in order to display content to the user, but no data ever leaves the device for servers accessible by PearDrop.

Tracking Technologies

Cookies, Beacons, and other Similar Technologies: Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by PearDrop. These technologies are used to make it easier for you to navigate our app and to store your password so you don’t have to enter it more than once.

Local Storage Objects: We may use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) to store data for improved user experience.

Third Party Service Providers

We work with a third party service provider to help improve the quality of our service. This third party does not share your information with any other third parties. PearDrop uses the following third party service on the App:

Flutter Sentry - Flutter Sentry is a library used to report errors thrown by our app to an error tracking service. This allows our developer team to continue to improve and refine the user experience. Sentry.io is open source and can be viewed at https://github.com/flutter/sentry. Sentry.io does not share user information with any other third parties.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this statement and other places we deem appropriate. We reserve the right to modify this statement at any time, so please review it frequently. You understand that through your use of the Products, you consent to the use (as set forth in this Agreement, the Privacy Policy) of your information for processing by PearDrop.
